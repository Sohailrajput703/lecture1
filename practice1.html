Topic: Git software and Git hub
What is Git? Purposes of the Git software and git hub?
Git is used ‘actually’ when we are working in our old version and want to do some changing in our project.
By using git, we can check the what are changing are to be done.
Some time new version or new changing that you have done in older version but that have some bugs inside then you can go back to your new version.
